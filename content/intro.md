# An Educator's Guide to Data 8

Data 8 is a "Foundations in Data Science" course taught for first year students at
UC Berkeley. It combines principles/skills in statistics, programming, inference, modeling,
hypothesis testing, visualization, and exploration. In short, it provides a foundation in
the many fields encompassed by "data science", and gives students a practical introduction
to the field.

This online resource serves as a "snapshot" of the Data 8 stack, and a guide providing
a path forward for others that wish to imitate the Data 8 model. It represents
all of the components that go into making Data 8 what it is. Including both
pedagogical approach, concepts / topics covered, and technical pieces used in
the class.

See the chapters to the left to navigate this book. Below is a general structure
of the material.

The Data 8 project has several components, all of which are freely-available and open-source.

## Deploying your own Data 8 course from scratch

The first section of this guide is a step-by-step guide that teaches you how to deploy your
own version of Data 8. It explains how to create a JupyterHub running in the cloud that students
can access, how to connect this JupyterHub with the coding environment that Data 8 students use,
and how to incorporate course materials into your class. Check it out here:

* [Deploying Data 8](deploy/README) describes how to set up your own Data 8 JupyterHub from scratch. It also contains suggestions and guidelines for running a Data 8 course at your own institution.

## Technical and pedagogical decisions for Data 8

These sections cove the high-level reasoning behind the Data 8 course, including an overview of
the technical and pedagogical pieces that make up the course. It should be treated as a reference
for running your own Data 8 course, or for taking a similar technical approach to teaching data science.

* [Teaching and Pedagogy](teaching/README) covers the unique blend of computational, coding, and conceptual information taught in Data 8.
* [The Data 8 Tech Stack](tech/README) describes the technical pieces of Data 8, including hosting student environments, grading, and managing the course.

## Other Data 8 information

All Data 8 materials are freely available online. The course material in full can be accessed
at the following online resources:

* [The Data 8 Course Site](https://www.data8.org)
