# Connector courses

Connector courses give an in-depth introduction to the ways in which data science
and the concepts covered in Data 8 are applied to a specific field. They
are not an official part of Data 8, though they play a crucial role in the data
science education ecosystem with the DSEP.

The following is a brief description of how Connector Courses are structured.

## General course structure
* **TODO**: section still needs structuring
* Course has associated github repository (ex: https://github.com/data-8/summer)
* Instructor pushes content into `gh-pages` branch
* Instructor embeds interact link in course web page (ex: http:data-8.github.io/summer)
* The connector program has a coordinator that liaises with instructors and Data8 infrastructure staff.


## Connector software stacks
* Neuro connector - Mne, nibabel, Pycortex
* Geospatial Connector - R kernel, gdal, Shapely, Geopy, Libjpeg-turbo
* Child Development - Pygrowup
* Humanities connector - Nltk, Gensim
* ~~Stat28 - R, R studio , Rpy2~~
