# Technology with Data 8

Data 8 operates a scale and level of complexity that required several
technological improvements to our current teaching toolset. The Data 8 team
worked closely with various open-source projects in order to contribute to
tools that are broadly useful.

This section describes some of the technical
infrastructure underlying the class, and provides a path forward for people who
are considering using these tools for their own teaching purposes.
