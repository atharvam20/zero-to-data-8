# Course structure and personnel

## Class structure

* MWF one-hour lectures
* one two-hour lab session
* 4 course credits
* TODO: homework / lab structure?

## Personnel
* Main instructor
* Team of undergraduate students
* TODO: Organization of the students?
* Both faculty and students work on course material <- makes things more scalable

## Homework and exercises
* The exercises are generally the same concepts but with a different dataset, they ask students to create new functions etc.
* Lots of different kinds of datasets they use with exercises
