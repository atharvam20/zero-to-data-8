# The Data 8 Teaching Philosophy

Teaching Data Science requires a shift in the way we traditionally teach each
of the individual concepts in the course. What were once several introductory
courses in statistics, computer science, writing, and ethics (among others)
are now combined into a single introductory course.

In Data 8, touching on these topics in a single course is a feature, not a bug.
For example, by teaching programming fundamentals of statistics, students gain an appreciation
for the close interplay between these two and learn a valuable set of skills
at the same time.

This section covers many of the pedagogical decisions that were made in Data 8.
It should be seen as a reference and background for the
[Data 8 textbook](https://www.inferentialthinking.com/), which is freely-available
online.
