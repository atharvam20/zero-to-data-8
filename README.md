# The DSEP Data 8 Stack

This online resource serves as a "snapshot" of the Data 8 stack. It represents
all of the components that go into making Data 8 what it is. Including both
pedagogical approach, concepts / topics covered, and technical pieces used in
the class.

See the chapters to the left to navigate this book. Below is a general structure
of the material.

## Structure of this guide

The DSEP Data 8 guide is broken up into several main sections:

1. General structure of the course
    * high-level information about the course
    * e.g., course credit, # classes, people needed, etc
2. Topics covered
    * Cover high-level pedagogical goals
    * short description of the topics covered
    * Defer to the `inferentialthinking` textbook for more detail + link to that as much as possible
3. Operationalizing the course
    * List the major things that "need to happen" in the course
    * Discuss the approach to this + the reason for this approach
    * Discuss the technology used to accomplish this task
4. How can I create my own Data 8?
    * A short, step-by-step guide of things to consider to replicate this model.
