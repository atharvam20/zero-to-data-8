# The DSEP Data 8 Stack

Data 8 is a "Foundations in Data Science" course taught for first year students at
UC Berkeley. It combines principles/skills in statistics, programming, inference, modeling,
hypothesis testing, visualization, and exploration. In short, it provides a foundation in
the many fields encompassed by "data science", and gives students a practical introduction
to the field.

This online resource serves as a "snapshot" of the Data 8 stack, and a guide providing
a path forward for others that wish to imitate the Data 8 model. It represents
all of the components that go into making Data 8 what it is. Including both
pedagogical approach, concepts / topics covered, and technical pieces used in
the class.

See the chapters to the left to navigate this book. Below is a general structure
of the material.

## Structure of this guide

The Data 8 project has several components, all of which are freely-available and open-source.
This guide details many of these components. Note that the course material in full can be accessed
at the following online resources:

* [The Data 8 Course Site](https://www.data8.org)
* [The Data 8 Course Textbook](https://www.inferentialthinking.com/)

The DSEP Data 8 guide is broken up into several main sections:

1. Course structure and pedagogy
    * Logistical / university structure of the course (e.g., course credit, classes, staffing)
    * High-level pedagogical goals and inspiration
    * General topics covered in the course syllabus, and reasons for doing so
2. Operationalizing the course with technology
    * List the major things that "need to happen" in the course
    * What pieces of technology did we use / build / contribute to?
    * What people and skills are needed to manage this process?
