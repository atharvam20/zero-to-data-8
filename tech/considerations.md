# Technical Considerations

## Priorities

* Keep costs down (NOTE: I know this isn't strictly true but it should be advertised as such)
* Assume a dynamic usage pattern of the infrastructure (e.g. class spikes, importance of considering downtime)
* Ensure that everything works during times of peak demand, these are crucial for the class to function.

## Major hurdles
* Setting up the environment on each student computer is a huge distraction / dis-equalizer.
* There are many options for interacting with the cloud, but most are bespoke interfaces that pair with a *product* you eventually pay for (e.g. https://aws.amazon.com/education/). Want this to be cloud agnostic.
* There often aren't platform-agnostic tools. When there aren't, see if we can support building them.
* Scaling class to large size requires technical + personnel that aren't always common in academia
* Find the right balance between theory and application, and operationalize this with code.
* Cover topics of *interest* to a broad audience without a strong computational background. Use real-world data as much as possible.
* Shield students from complex APIs and the myriad packages out there.
