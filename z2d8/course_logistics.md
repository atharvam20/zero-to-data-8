# Course Logistics

Data 8 has several moving parts in terms of course makeup and the
technical pieces that make it possible. In this section, we'll describe
some strategies that have worked well for Data 8. They should not be
taken as strict rules, but as guidelines that worked well for us. Feel
free to take a different approach!

## Grading

* **TODO: figure out a grading suggestion**

## Other stuff

* **TODO: think of some other logistical considerations. e.g.:
  * GSIs / student helpers
  * Technical support / maintenance
