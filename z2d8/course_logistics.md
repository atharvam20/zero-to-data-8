# Course Logistics

Data 8 has several moving parts in terms of course makeup and the
technical pieces that make it possible. In this section, we'll describe
some strategies that have worked well for Data 8. They should not be
taken as strict rules, but as guidelines that worked well for us. Feel
free to take a different approach!

## Grading

* <TODO: figure out a grading suggestion>

## Maintaining the JupyterHub

* Tips on how to keep the JupyterHub running / links to resources for more
  information. Here we should discuss more general tips rather than a complete
  guide.

## Contributing back to Data 8 materials

If you feel that there are changes / improvements that should be made to
the Data 8 material, feel free to open an issue at <TODO INSERT PROPER CHANNEL HERE>.
