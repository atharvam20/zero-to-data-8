# Using the Data 8 textbook

This page covers how to connect your course with the Data 8 textbook,
either via using the one hosted at [www.inferentialthinking.com][https://www.inferentialthinking.com]
or by customizing your own.

## The Data 8 Textbook

The [online Data 8 textbook](https://www.inferentialthinking.com/) is
built using a site generation engine called [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/),
and hosted online with the free [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) service.

For a short explanation of the structure / relevant files / etc of the
Data 8 textbook, see the [Data 8 textbook readme](https://github.com/data-8/textbook/blob/gh-pages/README.md).

You have two options for using the Data 8 textbook:

### Use the version of the textbook at [inferentialthinking.com](https://www.inferentialthinking.com)

The textbook hosted online should be suitable for most courses. The "interact" links
at the top of each page point to [mybinder.org](https://mybinder.org), a public
service that lets users interact with material online. If you wish, you may
send students links to this textbook for your course.


### Customize the textbook for your course

Alternatively, you may wish to
customize the textbook for your own course. The most common reason to do so is
in order to make "interact" links point to your JupyterHub. This way, students
can interact with textbook material in their own JupyterHub sessions, and their
work will persist over time.

To do so, follow the steps in the [customizing your textbook](../misc/custom_textbook.md)
guide.
